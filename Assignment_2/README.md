# Assignment 2 

In the assignment you need to build and validate a cognitive model of matching pennies behavior using Stan. As an outcome of this you will have to produce a text (+ plots) document (linked to a github repo) in which you:
- describe the model you are working on (N.B. it doesn't need to be one from Assignment 1)
- showcase a commented version of the stan model (what does each line do?)
- discuss model quality of the model (predictive prior and posterior checks, prior-posterior update checks, etc.)
- describe a process of parameter recovery (why are you doing it?, how are you doing it?)
- discuss the results: can you recover the parameter values? How many trials should be used at least to properly recover the parameters? Whatâ€™s the role of priors? Add relevant plot(s).

N.B. to pass it's enough to use the single agent model, but if you want to learn more (at the cost of more time investment), you could
- Build the multilevel version of your model and run the parameter recovery on it.
- Analyze an empirical dataset
